# Blind Writer

A simple text editor for my blind brother. The editor provides acoustic feedback on the pressed keys and only accepts a key if it is pressed twice in succession.

## Supported Documents
Currently only .txt files are supported.
Support for .odt is planned.

## Supported Languages 
As I'm German, all dialog and some file names are in German.
